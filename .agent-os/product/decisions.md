## 2025-08-17: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Developer

### Decision

ETA Watcher will be a smart commute monitoring application that automatically tracks Google Maps travel times and notifies users when their preferred travel duration is reached. The target market is traffic-conscious commuters and frequent travelers who want to optimize departure timing without manual monitoring.

### Context

Current traffic monitoring solutions require active user engagement - constantly checking Google Maps or Waze to watch for optimal travel conditions. This is time-consuming and often results in missed opportunities for optimal departure times. There's a gap in the market for passive, intelligent traffic monitoring with personalized thresholds.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Traffic Alert App**
   - Pros: Easier to build, faster time to market
   - Cons: Limited differentiation, doesn't solve core user pain point of manual monitoring

2. **Browser Extension for Google Maps**
   - Pros: Leverages existing Google Maps interface
   - Cons: Limited to desktop users, no mobile notifications, restricted by browser limitations

3. **Calendar-Integrated Solution**
   - Pros: Automatic activation based on scheduled events
   - Cons: Requires calendar access, more complex initial setup, limited to scheduled trips

### Rationale

The mobile app approach with Python backend was chosen because:
- Provides maximum flexibility for background monitoring
- Enables push notifications for optimal user experience
- Python ecosystem offers excellent API integration capabilities
- Mobile-first approach serves the primary use case of commuters
- Background processing allows for true "set and forget" functionality

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Solves a real user pain point with automated monitoring
- Differentiates from existing manual traffic apps
- Python tech stack enables rapid development and Google Maps integration
- Mobile platform provides optimal notification delivery

**Negative:**
- Requires Google Maps API usage costs
- Mobile development complexity with Python may require hybrid approach
- Background processing requires infrastructure for continuous monitoring
- Need to manage API rate limits and costs for real-time monitoring

## 2025-08-17: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer, Technical Lead

### Decision

Primary tech stack will be Python-based with FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, and either Kivy/BeeWare for pure Python mobile development or React Native with Python backend if mobile limitations are encountered.

### Context

User specifically requested Python as the preferred technology. Need to balance Python preference with mobile development requirements and real-time monitoring capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure Python Mobile (Kivy/BeeWare)**
   - Pros: Consistent language across stack, user preference
   - Cons: Limited mobile platform capabilities, smaller ecosystem

2. **React Native + Python Backend**
   - Pros: Better mobile capabilities, larger mobile ecosystem
   - Cons: Multiple languages, more complex development

3. **Native Mobile + Python Backend**
   - Pros: Best mobile performance and capabilities
   - Cons: Platform-specific development, multiple codebases

### Rationale

Starting with pure Python approach (Kivy/BeeWare) allows us to honor user preference while maintaining option to pivot to React Native if mobile limitations become blocking. FastAPI provides excellent API development experience with automatic documentation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent Python development experience
- Rapid backend development with FastAPI
- Strong Google Maps API integration capabilities
- Good documentation and testing ecosystem

**Negative:**
- Mobile development may face limitations with Python frameworks
- May need to pivot to hybrid approach later
- Smaller community for Python mobile development
