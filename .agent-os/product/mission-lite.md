# Product Mission (Lite)

GoTime is a smart commute monitoring app that helps traffic-conscious commuters minimize time spent in traffic by providing automated notifications when travel times reach their preferred duration between any two locations.

GoTime serves daily commuters and frequent travelers who want to optimize their departure timing without constantly monitoring traffic apps. Unlike Google Maps or Waze which require active monitoring, GoTime continuously tracks specified routes in the background and provides intelligent notifications based on personalized time thresholds and realistic timeout handling.
