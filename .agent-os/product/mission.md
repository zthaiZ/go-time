# Product Mission

## Pitch

GoTime is a smart commute monitoring app that helps traffic-conscious commuters minimize time spent in traffic by providing automated notifications when travel times reach their preferred duration between any two locations.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Daily Commuters**: Working professionals who commute regularly and want to optimize their travel timing
- **Traffic-Sensitive Travelers**: Anyone who frequently travels between specific locations and wants to avoid peak traffic

### User Personas

**The Efficient Commuter** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Working Professional
- **Context:** Regular daily commute to office, wants to maximize personal time
- **Pain Points:** Wasting time monitoring traffic apps, getting stuck in unexpected traffic, unpredictable commute times
- **Goals:** Leave at optimal time, minimize commute duration, better work-life balance

**The Strategic Traveler** (30-55 years old)
- **Role:** Business Professional / Parent
- **Context:** Frequent trips between multiple locations throughout the day
- **Pain Points:** Constantly checking traffic conditions, missing optimal travel windows, scheduling conflicts due to traffic
- **Goals:** Efficient time management, predictable travel schedules, reduced stress from traffic uncertainty

## The Problem

### Traffic Monitoring is Time-Consuming and Inefficient

Most people waste valuable time constantly refreshing map applications to monitor traffic conditions, waiting for the "right" moment to leave. This manual process is both tedious and prone to missing optimal travel windows.

**Our Solution:** Automated background monitoring with intelligent notifications when travel conditions meet your preferences.

### Unpredictable Traffic Patterns Cause Scheduling Issues

Traffic conditions change rapidly throughout the day, making it difficult to plan departure times effectively. People either leave too early and waste time, or leave too late and get stuck in traffic.

**Our Solution:** Continuous real-time monitoring with customizable thresholds and timeout handling for realistic travel planning.

## Differentiators

### Intelligent Background Monitoring

Unlike Google Maps or Waze which require active monitoring, GoTime continuously tracks your specified routes in the background and only notifies you when conditions are optimal. This eliminates the need for constant manual checking.

### Customizable Travel Time Thresholds

Unlike basic traffic apps that just show current conditions, we provide personalized notifications based on your specific time preferences and tolerance levels, with smart timeout features for unrealistic expectations.

### Route-Specific Optimization

Unlike general traffic apps, GoTime focuses specifically on your frequently traveled routes, learning your patterns and providing targeted notifications for the journeys that matter most to you.
