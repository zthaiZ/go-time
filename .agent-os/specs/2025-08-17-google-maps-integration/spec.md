# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Google Maps Integration
> Created: 2025-08-17

## Overview

Integrate Google Maps Platform APIs to enable continuous monitoring of travel times between user-specified locations. This foundational feature will provide the core "watching" capability that allows users to set target travel durations and receive notifications when optimal conditions are reached, eliminating the need for manual traffic monitoring.

## User Stories

### Continuous Route Monitoring

As a commuter, I want to set up monitoring for my commute route with a target travel time, so that I can be automatically notified when traffic conditions become favorable without constantly checking my phone.

The system will continuously poll the Google Maps Directions API at regular intervals, comparing current travel times against the user's target duration. When the travel time drops to or below the target, the system will trigger a notification. The monitoring will also include timeout logic to cancel watching after a reasonable period if the target is never reached.

### API Credential Management

As a developer, I want secure API credential management, so that the application can authenticate with Google Maps services without exposing sensitive keys.

The system will securely store and manage Google Maps API credentials, handle authentication, and provide proper error handling for API quota limits and authentication failures.

## Spec Scope

1. **Google Maps API Setup** - Configure API credentials and establish secure authentication
2. **Geocoding Service** - Convert addresses to coordinates using Google Maps Geocoding API
3. **Continuous Travel Time Monitoring** - Scheduled polling of Directions API to track travel duration changes
4. **Target Threshold Detection** - Compare current travel times against user-defined target durations
5. **Notification Triggering** - Trigger alerts when travel time reaches target or timeout occurs
6. **Monitoring Session Management** - Start, stop, and timeout monitoring sessions with proper cleanup

## Out of Scope

- Route optimization or alternative route suggestions
- Historical travel time data storage
- User interface or mobile app components
- Push notification delivery mechanisms (this spec handles notification triggering only)
- Multiple simultaneous route monitoring

## Expected Deliverable

1. Python service that continuously monitors travel time between two addresses and detects when target duration is reached
2. Monitoring session management with configurable polling intervals and timeout handling
3. Notification event system that triggers when travel time targets are met or monitoring times out
4. Secure API key management and comprehensive error handling for API failures
5. Unit tests covering monitoring workflows, threshold detection, and timeout scenarios
