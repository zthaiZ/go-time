# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-17-google-maps-integration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Python Package Structure** - Create modular `maps/` package with separate modules for geocoding, directions, monitoring, and configuration
- **Google Maps Client** - Use `googlemaps` Python library for API interactions with proper connection pooling and retry logic
- **Background Task Processing** - Implement scheduled monitoring using asyncio or threading for continuous polling
- **Monitoring Session Management** - Track active monitoring sessions with start/stop controls and automatic cleanup
- **Threshold Detection Logic** - Compare current travel times against target durations with configurable tolerance
- **Timeout Handling** - Implement configurable timeout periods to automatically cancel monitoring sessions
- **Notification Event System** - Event-driven architecture to trigger notifications when targets are met or timeouts occur
- **Environment Configuration** - Implement secure API key management using `python-dotenv` with `.env` file and environment variable fallbacks
- **Geocoding Functionality** - Convert addresses to lat/lng coordinates with validation and error handling for ambiguous or invalid addresses
- **Directions API Integration** - Query travel times with traffic data, departure time options, and travel mode selection (driving, walking, transit)
- **Response Parsing** - Extract duration, distance, and route information from API responses with proper data validation
- **Rate Limiting** - Implement client-side rate limiting to respect Google Maps API quotas and avoid 429 errors
- **Polling Intervals** - Configurable polling frequency (e.g., every 2-5 minutes) to balance accuracy with API usage costs
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive exception handling for network errors, API quota exceeded, invalid credentials, and malformed responses
- **Logging** - Structured logging with appropriate log levels for debugging API interactions and monitoring session lifecycle
- **Data Models** - Define Pydantic models for monitoring sessions, location coordinates, route requests, and API responses

## External Dependencies

- **googlemaps** (>=4.10.0) - Official Google Maps Python client library
- **python-dotenv** (>=1.0.0) - Environment variable management for secure API key storage
- **pydantic** (>=2.0.0) - Data validation and parsing for API request/response models
- **requests** (>=2.31.0) - HTTP client library (dependency of googlemaps)

**Justification:** These are industry-standard libraries for Google Maps integration with proven reliability and security features.
